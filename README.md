# Text Analysis of Oireachtas Debates


## Topic modelling the Banking Inquiry

The purpose of the report [of the Joint Committee of Investigation into the Banking Crisis] is to tell the story of what happened so that future historians, and possibly PhD students, will mine it for commentary on what brought our island down.

As a trial run for a wider research project, I've created a topic model of the hearings of the [Joint Committee of Inquiry into the the Banking Crisis](https://inquiries.oireachtas.ie/banking/), or the Banking Inquiry as it's more commonly known. 

Read the [topic-handler notebook](topic-handler.ipynb) for the code or just view the [visualisation](https://rawgit.com/stephenrigney/debates/a9e85c5091960b3e28716245d39042258f9641c9/banking_lda.html). Setting the relevance slider at between 0.4 and 0.6 will give the most meaningful clusters.
